<h2>1. Variables</h2>
<hr>
<p>In C language, variables are used to store data values of different types. Variables act as containers for holding data that can be manipulated by the program during execution. Each variable in C must have a specific data type that defines the kind of value it can store (e.g., integer, float, character).
   <br> Basic Syntax:
<br>data_type variable_name = value;<br>
data_type: Type of data the variable will store (e.g., int, float, char).<br>
variable_name: The name of the variable.<br>
value (optional): Initial value assigned to the variable<br>
</p>
<h2>2.Data Types</h2>
<hr>
<p>In C, data types define the type of data that a variable can hold and the operations that can be performed on it. C has several basic data types:

    <br>Integer types:
    
    <br>int: Used for storing whole numbers, typically 4 bytes in size.
    <br>short: A smaller integer type (usually 2 bytes).
    <br>long: A larger integer type (often 4 or 8 bytes).
    <br>Floating-point types:
    
    <br>float: Used for single-precision floating-point numbers (decimals).
    <br>double: Double-precision floating-point numbers, offering greater accuracy.
    <br>Character type:
    
    <br>char: Used for storing single characters (1 byte).
    <br>Void type:
    
    <br>void: Used to indicate the absence of a value, commonly in functions that do not return a value.
    <br> Additionally, there are modifiers like unsigned and signed to control whether variables can store negative values. Understanding these types is essential for memory-efficient and effective programming in C.</p>
    <h2>3. Operators</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>In C, operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. C provides several types of operators:

       <br> Arithmetic operators:<br> Used for mathematical operations like addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and modulus (%).
        
       <br>Relational operators:<br> Compare values and return true or false, such as greater than (>), less than (<), equal to (==), and not equal to (!=).
        
       <br> Logical operators: <br>Used for logical conditions, like AND (&&), OR (||), and NOT (!).
        
       <br> Bitwise operators:<br> Perform bit-level operations, including AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), and bit shifts (<<, >>).
        
       <br> Assignment operators:<br> Assign values to variables, like the simple assignment (=) and compound assignments (+=, -=, etc.).
        
       <br> Increment and Decrement operators: <br>Increase (++) or decrease (--) a variableâ€™s value by one.
        
       <br>Conditional (ternary) operator:<br> A compact form of an if-else statement (? :).
        
       <br> These operators form the core of manipulating data and making decisions in C programs.</p>
